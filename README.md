## About Project. 
This is a simple Vue starter WordPress Plugin. I was trying to stand up basic skeleton With Vue. With this plugin if you start to make your own plugin then you will get benified becuase this plugin has already a good structure. By integrating vue technology in this plugin you can manage data without any loading in your WordPress Page.
